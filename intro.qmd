## What is it good for?

The aforementioned bibliographic information is descriptive metadata that allows
the targeted retrieval of publications.

At first glance, bibliographic information appears less useful than the full 
text. However, imagine trying to find all the literature relevant to a certain 
subject with just the full texts.
